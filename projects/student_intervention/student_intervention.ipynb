In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "The model called SVM tries to find a linear plane to separate two categories as neatly as possible, to do so it needs to find data points in training data that can define decision boundary, then based on those data points we can calculate some transformed 'distance' to classify new data points. It uses a transformation called kernel trick to project data points into higher dimensions, for example from two dimension to three dimension, so to make data points sparser from each other and thus make sure the model can find a linear plane to separate two categories. Once it finds such plane, it memories data points closest to the plane to set up a decision boundary, then if new data points come in, SVM projects them the same way it projects all training data into same high dimensional space, calculate the distance between test data and those memorized data points, and do classification."
